## 1. First Lesson

### 1.1. Getting Started

Write a program to display your name and age. To deal with it one should use a `printf()` function.

Sample Ouput:

```c
Nick Smith, 19
```

### 1.2. Data Types and Declarations

Write a program to declarate a couple of variables (`a`, `b`, `c`):

Variant | `a` | `b` | `c`
- | - | - | -
First | 457 | 6.03 | 'c'
Second | 373 | 'x' | 167.314
Third | 60.2 | 'e' | 442
Fourth | 122.1 | 560 | 'w'
Fifth | 'f' | 1132 | 39.6
Sixth | 'y' | 77.9 | 2502

Choose according basic data type for each variable:

| Data Type | Description |
| - | - |
| `char` | A single character. |
| `int` | An integer. |
| `double` | A floating point number. |

Display variables values.

Sample Ouput:

```c
a = 1
b = 3.14
c = 'h'
```

### 1.3. `If-Else` Statement

> Syntax:
>
> ```c
> if (expression)
>   statement1
> else
>   statement2
> ```

Write a program using `if-else` statement:

Variant | Description
- | -
First | Create an integer and check whether it is even or odd.
Second | Create an integer and check whether it is positive or non-positive.
Third | Create an integer and check whether it is negative or non-negative.
Fourth | Create two integers and check whether they are equal or not.
Fifth | Create two integers and check if the first is bigger than the second.
Sixth | Create two integers and check if the first is smaller than the second.

Display the results.

### 1.4. `If-Else` Statements Chain

> Syntax:
>
> ```c
> if (expression1)
>   statement1
> else if (expression2)
>   statement2
> else if (expression3)
>   statement3
> else
>   statement4
> ```

Write a program using `if-else` statements chain:

Variant | Description
- | -
First | Create three different integers and find the biggest value.
Second | Create three different integers and find the smallest value.
Third | Create three different integers and find the biggest value.
Fourth | Create three different integers and find the smallest value.
Fifth | Create three different integers and find the biggest value.
Sixth | Create three different integers and find the smallest value.

Display the results.

### 1.5 Operators

Write a program to calculate an expression:

Variant | Description
- | -
First | Create three floating point numbers and calculate their average value.
Second | Create three floating point numbers and check whether their sum is greater than their multiplication.
Third | Create three floating point numbers and check if the first two numbers' sum is greater than the third number.
Fourth | Create three floating point numbers and check if the first two numbers' multiplication is equal to the third number.
Fifth | Create three floating point numbers and check whether all of them are positive or non-positive.
Sixth | Create three floating point numbers and check whether all of them are negative or non-negative.

Display the results.
