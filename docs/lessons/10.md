**Rock-paper-scissors game**

Create a game in which the `Player` will compete with the `Computer` in the rock-paper-scissors game.

A player who decides to play `rock` will beat another player who has chosen `scissors`, but will lose to one who has played `paper`; a play of `paper` will lose to a play of `scissors`. If both players choose the same shape, the game's turn is tied and is immediately replayed to break the tie.

The game consists of three turns. The winner is the player who wins twice.

Game's algorithm:

1. Ask the `Player` to enter a nickname.
2. Display the turn's number.
3. Ask the `Player` to choose a shape.
4. The `Player` enters the name of the desired shape.
5. Select a random figure for the `Computer`.
6. If the `Computer` and the `Player` have chosen the same shapes, go to step `3`.
7. Determine the winner of this turn.
8. Display the name of the winner of the turn.
9. If one of the players has already won twice, finish the game. Otherwise go to step `2`.
10. Display the name of the winner of the game.

Sample output:

```
Please, enter your nickname: Nick Smith
