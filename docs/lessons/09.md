# 9. Standard library: miscellaneous

## 9.1. `string.h`

> This header file defines several functions to manipulate strings and arrays. Here are some of them:
>
> ```c
> /**
>  * Appends a copy of the source string to the destination string.
>  * The terminating null character in destination is overwritten by the first
>  * character of source, and a null-character is included at the end
>  * of the new string formed by the concatenation of both in destination.
>  *
>  * @param destination Pointer to the destination array,
>  * which should contain a string, and be large enough
>  * to contain the concatenated resulting string.
>  *
>  * @param source String to be appended. This should not overlap destination.
>  *
>  * @return destination is returned.
>  */
> char* strcat(char* destination, const char* source);
>
> /**
>  * Compares the string str1 to the string str2.
>  * This function starts comparing the first character of each string.
>  * If they are equal to each other, it continues with the following pairs until
>  * the characters differ or until a terminating null-character is reached.
>  *
>  * @param str1 String to be compared.
>  * @param str2 String to be compared.
>  *
>  * @return An integral value indicating the relationship between the strings:
>  * !=0 - the contents the strings are different.
>  * ==0 - the contents of both strings are equal.
>  */
> int strcmp(const char* str1, const char* str2);
>
> /**
>  * Returns the length of the string str.
>  * The length of a C string is determined by the terminating null-character:
>  * a string is as long as the number of characters between the beginning
>  * of the string and the terminating null character (without including
>  * the terminating null character itself).
>  *
>  * @param str A string.
>  * @return The length of string.
>  */
> size_t strlen(const char* str);

Execute the task using the functions from `string.h`.

## 9.2. `math.h`

Create the `f()` function using the functions from `math.h`:

```c
double f(double x);
```

The function should return the result of the mathematical formula:

| Variant | Mathematical formula                                                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | $f(x) = \frac{ sin^{2}(x) + cos^{2}(x) }{ e^{x} }$                                             |
| 2       | $f(x) = \sqrt{ lg(e^{x}) + x^{8} }$                                                            |
| 3       | $f(x) = \vert x^{9} + 2x^{5} - 10x^{3} \vert$                                                  |
| 4       | $f(x) = \frac{ e^{x} + e^{-x} }{ lg^{2}(x) }$                                                  |
| 5       | $f(x) = \big( \frac{ sin(x) }{ cos(x) } \big)^{2} + \big( \frac{ cos(x) }{ sin(x) } \big)^{2}$ |
| 6       | $f(x) = ln(x^{5}) + \vert cos^{3}(x) - sin^{3}(x) \vert$                                       |

Demonstrate at least three examples of using the `f()` function in the `main()` function.

## 9.3. `ctype.h`

Read a character from the standard input. Using the functions from `ctype.h` check if the character  ...

| Variant | Description                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1       | ... is alphabetic.              |
| 2       | ... is decimal digit.           |
| 3       | ... is hexadecimal digit.       |
| 4       | ... is a punctuation character. |
| 5       | ... is lowercase letter.        |
| 6       | ... is uppercase letter.        |
